  description: |
    Jujutsu is a powerful version control system for software projects. 
    You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes to the code, and 
    finally publish those changes for others to see and use. It is designed 
    from the ground up to be easy to useâ€”whether you're new or experienced, 
    working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software projects 
    with large histories and teams.
